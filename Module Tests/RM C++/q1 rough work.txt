hospital management system using oop objective: Design and implement cpp program 
that models hospital management system using oop principles encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism.

encapsulation: use private data members for patients and doctor details 
provide public methods to access and update data securely

absstraction:
create an abstract class HospitalPerson with pure virtual function:
displayDetails()
getRole()

inheritance:
Derive two classes from HospitalPerson:
patients:(should include) patient ID, name, age, illness, assigned doctor 
doctor:doctor id, name, specialization, list of assigned patients

polymorphism:
use virtual functions to override 
displayDetails()
getRole()
in derived classes Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using base class pointers.


functional req:
1. create and store data for atleast 4 patients and 2 doctors
2. assign patients to doctors based on specialization
3. Display details of all hospital persons using polymorphic behavior
4. use constructors and deconstructors
