Your code is now corrected! The `Radio` component will accept text input and provide three radio buttons for uppercase, lowercase, and title case. The output updates according to the selected option. All necessary imports and logic are included. If you need further adjustments or styling, let me know!

sumitn071201-pixel: explain the code

GitHub Copilot: Here’s an explanation of your `Radio` component code:

- The component imports `useState` from React to manage state.
- The `toTitleCase` function converts a string so each word starts with an uppercase letter and the rest are lowercase.
- The component maintains two pieces of state:
  - `text`: the value of the text input.
  - `caseType`: which radio button is selected (`upper`, `lower`, or `title`).
- The `output` variable is computed based on the selected case type:
  - If "Uppercase" is selected, it shows the text in all uppercase.
  - If "Lowercase" is selected, it shows the text in all lowercase.
  - If "Title Case" is selected, it shows the text in title case.
- The UI includes:
  - A text input for entering text.
  - Three radio buttons for selecting the case transformation.
  - The transformed output is displayed below.

This component lets users type text and instantly see it transformed according to the selected case option.

sumitn071201-pixel: most commonly used str regular expression

GitHub Copilot: Here are some of the most commonly used string regular expressions in JavaScript:

1. **Email validation**
   ```
   /^[\\w.-]+@[\\w.-]+\\.\\w{2,}$/
   ```

2. **Phone number (basic, digits only)**
   ```
   /^\\d{10}$/
   ```

3. **URL validation**
   ```
   /^(https?:\\/\\/)?([\\w.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})([\\/\\w .-]*)*\\/?$/
   ```

4. **Only letters**
   ```
   /^[A-Za-z]+$/
   ```

5. **Only numbers**
   ```
   /^\\d+$/
   ```

6. **Alphanumeric**
   ```
   /^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/
   ```

7. **Whitespace trimming**
   ```
   /^\\s+|\\s+$/g
   ```

8. **Password (at least one letter, one number, min 8 chars)**
   ```
   /^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\\d)[A-Za-z\\d]{8,}$/
   ```

Let me know if you need a regex for a specific use case!

sumitn071201-pixel: how can i write an expression on my own

GitHub Copilot: To write a regular expression on your own, follow these steps:

1. **Define your goal:** Decide what pattern you want to match (e.g., email, numbers, specific words).
2. **Break down the pattern:** Identify the components (letters, digits, special characters, repetitions).
3. **Use regex symbols:**
   - `^` = start of string
   - `$` = end of string
   - `.` = any character
   - `*` = zero or more
   - `+` = one or more
   - `?` = zero or one
   - `[abc]` = any of a, b, or c
   - `\\d` = digit
   - `\\w` = word character (letter, digit, underscore)
   - `\\s` = whitespace
   - `(abc)` = group
   - `{n,m}` = between n and m times

4. **Build and test:** Combine symbols to form your expression. Test it using online tools like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) or in your code.

**Example:**  
To match a 5-digit number:  
`/^\\d{5}$/`

Start simple, test often, and adjust as needed! If you have a specific pattern in mind, I can help you build it.
