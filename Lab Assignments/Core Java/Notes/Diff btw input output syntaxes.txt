You're absolutely right — Java I/O classes can feel like a maze 🧩. Let’s break them down by category, purpose, and how they relate to each other. I’ll also give you a memory trick to help keep them straight.

## 🧵 Byte vs Character Streams

| Category            | Class Name             | Purpose                                 | Data Type |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Byte Stream**     | `FileInputStream`      | Reads raw bytes from a file              | Binary    |
|                     | `FileOutputStream`     | Writes raw bytes to a file               | Binary    |
|                     | `BufferedInputStream`  | Adds buffering to byte input             | Binary    |
|                     | `BufferedOutputStream` | Adds buffering to byte output            | Binary    |
|                     | `DataInputStream`      | Reads primitive data types from bytes    | Binary    |
|                     | `DataOutputStream`     | Writes primitive data types to bytes     | Binary    |
| **Character Stream**| `FileReader`           | Reads characters from a file             | Text      |
|                     | `FileWriter`           | Writes characters to a file              | Text      |
|                     | `BufferedReader`       | Adds buffering to character input        | Text      |
|                     | `BufferedWriter`       | Adds buffering to character output       | Text      |

## 🧠 Memory Trick: “F-B-D” and “R-W”

Think of it like this:

### 1. **F = File** (basic access)
- `FileInputStream` / `FileOutputStream` → for binary files
- `FileReader` / `FileWriter` → for text files

### 2. **B = Buffered** (performance boost)
- Wraps around File classes to make reading/writing faster
- `BufferedInputStream` / `BufferedOutputStream`
- `BufferedReader` / `BufferedWriter`

### 3. **D = Data** (structured data)
- `DataInputStream` / `DataOutputStream` → for reading/writing Java primitives (int, float, etc.)

### 4. **R-W = Read/Write**
- InputStream/Reader → Read
- OutputStream/Writer → Write

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- **Reading a text file line by line** → `BufferedReader` + `FileReader`
- **Writing a string to a file** → `BufferedWriter` + `FileWriter`
- **Reading an image file** → `BufferedInputStream` + `FileInputStream`
- **Saving structured data (int, float)** → `DataOutputStream` + `FileOutputStream`
